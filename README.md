# xsSpawn
This is a reworked spawn system using xstrems Halo/Ground spawn options and Super Jerome base spawn script. I have taken the customizable features provided from SeanjSOS merged ePoch and added them into this version of xsSpawn. I have added two knew features that allow server admins to turn off Halo or Ground options for bases. This base spawn system allows all flag owners and/or players on the build rights to spawn at each flag once for a set amount of time (Default 15 minutes) determined by the server admin. I am only responsible for the merging of the two systems together, adding the features, and by no means claim any of the base code as my own work.
